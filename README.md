# Opus to CAF Converter
This repository provides a script with a function called ConvertOpusToCaf that converts an Opus file to a Core Audio Format (CAF) file. The Opus codec is designed for high-quality, low-latency audio compression, while the Core Audio Format is a container format developed by Apple for use with their Core Audio framework.

The significance of this repository is to provide a simple and efficient way to convert Opus files to CAF files, which can be useful in applications that require compatibility with Apple's Core Audio framework or other platforms that support CAF files.

## Usage
The ConvertOpusToCaf function accepts two arguments:

* i (string): The input file path of the Opus file to be converted.
* o (string): The output file path where the converted CAF file will be saved.
Example usage:

```go
package main

func main() {
    inputOpus := "input.opus"
    outputCaf := "output.caf"
    ConvertOpusToCaf(inputOpus, outputCaf)
}
```
## Dependencies
This script relies on the following external packages:

- *os*: Provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality.
- *io*: Provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.
- *errors*: Implements functions to manipulate errors.
- bytes: Implements functions for the manipulation of byte slices.
- math: Provides basic constants and mathematical functions.
- Make sure you have these packages available in your Go environment to use this script successfully.

## Implementation Details
The ConvertOpusToCaf function performs the following steps:

- Opens the input Opus file and initializes the Opus decoder.
- Loops through the Opus file, parsing each page and extracting audio data and frame sizes.
- Constructs a new CAF file with the appropriate headers, chunks, and audio data.
- Writes the CAF file to the specified output file path.
- Please note that the provided script only supports mono and stereo audio channels. If you need to work with other channel configurations, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
